# Calculate genotype-phenotype concordance from binary matrix

Compares genotypes (presence of resistance markers) to observed
phenotypes (resistant vs susceptible) using a binary matrix from
[`get_binary_matrix()`](https://AMRverse.github.io/AMRgen/reference/get_binary_matrix.md).
A genotypic prediction variable is defined on the basis of presence of
genotype markers (either any marker in the input table, or those defined
by an input inclusion list or exclusion list). This genotypic prediction
is then compared to the observed phenotypes using standard
classification metrics (via the `yardstick` pkg) and AMR-specific error
rates (major error, ME and very major error, VME) per ISO 20776-2 (and
see [FDA
definitions](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/guidance-documents-medical-devices-and-radiation-emitting-products/antimicrobial-susceptibility-test-ast-systems-class-ii-special-controls-guidance-industry-and-fda)).
Supports evaluating both R and NWT outcomes in a single call, with
flexible prediction rules and marker inclusion options.

## Usage

``` r
concordance(
  binary_matrix,
  markers = NULL,
  exclude_markers = NULL,
  ppv_threshold = NULL,
  ppv_results = NULL,
  truth = c("R", "NWT"),
  prediction_rule = "any",
  min_count = NULL,
  logreg_results = NULL,
  pval_threshold = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- binary_matrix:

  A data frame output by
  [`get_binary_matrix()`](https://AMRverse.github.io/AMRgen/reference/get_binary_matrix.md),
  containing one row per sample, columns indicating binary phenotypes
  (`R`, `I`, `NWT`) and binary marker presence/absence.

- markers:

  A character vector of marker column names to include in a new binary
  outcome variable `genotypic_prediction`. Default `NULL` includes all
  marker columns.

- exclude_markers:

  A character vector of marker column names to exclude from the
  genotypic prediction. Applied after `markers` filtering.

- ppv_threshold:

  A numeric PPV threshold (0-1). Markers with solo PPV below this value
  are excluded. Requires `ppv_results`.

- ppv_results:

  Output of
  [`solo_ppv_analysis()`](https://AMRverse.github.io/AMRgen/reference/solo_ppv_analysis.md)
  **or** [`ppv()`](https://AMRverse.github.io/AMRgen/reference/ppv.md),
  used for solo PPV-based marker filtering when `ppv_threshold` is set.
  When the output of
  [`ppv()`](https://AMRverse.github.io/AMRgen/reference/ppv.md) is
  supplied, single-marker entries (`marker_count == 1`) in the `summary`
  table are used to obtain per-marker PPVs, making the behaviour
  equivalent to supplying
  [`solo_ppv_analysis()`](https://AMRverse.github.io/AMRgen/reference/solo_ppv_analysis.md)
  output directly.

- truth:

  A character vector specifying the phenotypic truth column(s) to
  evaluate: `"R"` (resistant vs susceptible/intermediate), `"NWT"`
  (non-wildtype vs wildtype), or `c("R", "NWT")` (default) to evaluate
  both.

- prediction_rule:

  The rule for generating genotypic predictions: `"any"` (default)
  predicts positive if any marker is present (after applying filters as
  specified by `markers`, `exclude_markers`, `ppv_threshold`,
  `pval_threshold`, `min_count`); `"all"` predicts positive only if all
  markers are present (after applying filters as specified by `markers`,
  `exclude_markers`, `ppv_threshold`, `pval_threshold`, `min_count`); a
  positive integer predicts positive if at least that many markers are
  present (after applying filters as specified by `markers`,
  `exclude_markers`, `ppv_threshold`, `pval_threshold`, `min_count`);
  `"logistic"` uses a logistic regression model from `logreg_results` to
  predict outcomes for each sample.

- min_count:

  An integer or `NULL`. Exclude markers with total frequency (column sum
  in binary_matrix) below this value. Default `NULL` (no filtering).

- logreg_results:

  Output of
  [`amr_logistic()`](https://AMRverse.github.io/AMRgen/reference/amr_logistic.md).
  Used for p-value filtering (when `pval_threshold` is set) and for
  `prediction_rule = "logistic"`.

- pval_threshold:

  A numeric p-value threshold. Exclude markers with logistic regression
  p-value \>= this value. Requires `logreg_results`.

## Value

An S3 object of class `"amr_concordance"`, a list containing:

- `conf_mat`: Named list of yardstick confusion matrix objects (e.g.
  `list(R = <cm>, NWT = <cm>)`).

- `metrics`: A tibble with columns `outcome`, `metric`, `estimate`.

- `data`: The input binary matrix with added `R_pred` and/or `NWT_pred`
  columns.

- `markers_used`: Named list of character vectors of markers used per
  outcome.

- `truth_col`: Character vector of truth columns evaluated.

- `n`: Named integer vector of sample counts per outcome.

- `prediction_rule`: The prediction rule used.

## Details

The function identifies marker columns as all columns not in the
reserved set (`id`, `pheno`, `ecoff`, `R`, `I`, `NWT`, `mic`, `disk`).
It then applies filtering in order: inclusion list `markers`, exclusion
list `exclude_markers`, `min_count`, `ppv_threshold` filtering, then
`pval_threshold` filtering.

Marker filtering is performed per outcome (R, NWT), since PPV-based and
p-value-based filters are category/outcome-specific.

Standard metrics (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, kappa,
F-measure) are calculated using pkg `yardstick`. AMR-specific error
rates are computed internally:

- **VME** (Very Major Error): FN / (TP + FN) = 1 - sensitivity.
  Proportion of truly resistant isolates not predicted as such from
  genotype.

- **ME** (Major Error): FP / (TN + FP) = 1 - specificity. Proportion of
  truly susceptible isolates incorrectly predicted resistant from
  genotype.
