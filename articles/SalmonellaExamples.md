# Analysing a small user-generated Salmonella geno-pheno dataset

## Introduction

This vignette shows how `AMRgen` can be used to explore a small
user-generated dataset with genotypic and phenotypic data for
non-typhoidal, non-invasive *Salmonella enterica* isolates. Phenotypic
data consists of MIC E-test results for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and
moxifloxacin. Genotypic data includes AMRFinderPlus results for
quinolone resistance markers.

Start by loading the package:

``` r
library(AMRgen)
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

### Import data

In this example, the data table was exported from the user’s laboratory
information management system as a single `.csv` file that includes both
genotypic and phenotypic results for 115 *S. enterica* isolates, with
one line per isolate. There are columns for two categorical variables of
interest: isolate source (human, animal, or other) and isolate serovar.
Genotype data is stored in a single column, and where multiple quinolone
resistance markers were identified, these are listed in a string with
semicolon delimiters. Phenotype data is stored in separate columns for
each antimicrobial agent that was tested (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin,
moxifloxacin).

``` r
# Raw data table
salm_raw <- read_csv(here::here("data", "Salmonella_pheno_geno_data.csv"))
```

``` r
head(salm_raw)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 7
#>   Sample Source Serovar     CpL_Genotype Ciprofloxacin Levofloxacin Moxifloxacin
#>   <chr>  <chr>  <chr>       <chr>        <chr>         <chr>        <chr>

#> 5 SAL005 Human  other       gyrA_D87Y    0.094         0.25         0.38        
#> 6 SAL006 Human  S. Kentucky gyrA_S83F;g… 8             8            32
```

The `AMRgen` package requires separate phenotypic and genotypic tables
with specific column headers, so the next step is to separate and
wrangle these data into the required formats.

### Genotype table

To use downstream `AMRgen` functions, a genotype table must have at a
minimum the following columns: `Name` (unique sample name for each
isolate), `marker` (name of the resistance marker detected), and
`drug_class` (antibiotic class associated with this marker). It also
needs to be in long form, with a row for each isolate/marker
combination. In our dataset, the genotype information is found in a
single column alongside the metadata and phenotypic information, and we
can have multiple markers per row (up to four). Here, we carry out the
following steps to generate a genotype table that is compatible with
`AMRgen` functions: \* Select only the genotype column (called
`CpL_Genotype` in this dataset) and the column specifying the individual
isolate names (called `Sample` in this dataset) \* Rename the column
`Sample` to `Name`, which is the default column heading used by `AMRgen`
for identifying individual isolates \* Separate the genotype column
`CpL_Genotype` into individual columns for each marker (up to four per
isolate in these data), specifying the delimiter `;` \* Convert this
wide-form data (one row per isolate) to a long-form table (one row per
isolate/marker combination) using `pivot_longer` \* Add a column
specifying that all these markers are associated with resistance to
quinolones

``` r
# Extract geno data, separate by delimiter, pivot longer, and add drug_class column
salm_geno <- salm_raw %>%
  select(Sample, CpL_Genotype) %>%
  rename(Name = Sample) %>%
  separate_wider_delim(CpL_Genotype,
    delim = ";", names = c("Marker_1", "Marker_2", "Marker_3", "Marker_4"),
    too_few = "align_start", cols_remove = TRUE
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(Marker_1, Marker_2, Marker_3, Marker_4),
    names_to = "marker_no",
    values_to = "marker",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) %>%
  select(-marker_no) %>%
  mutate(
    drug_class = "Quinolones",
    drug_agent = NA_character_
  ) ## the variable drug_agent appears essential for get_binary_matrix function to work...


# Check the format of the processed genotype table
head(salm_geno)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 4
#>   Name   marker    drug_class drug_agent
#>   <chr>  <chr>     <chr>      <chr>     
#> 1 SAL001 gyrA_S83F Quinolones NA        
#> 2 SAL001 parC_T57S Quinolones NA        
#> 3 SAL002 gyrA_S83Y Quinolones NA        
#> 4 SAL003 gyrA_S83F Quinolones NA        
#> 5 SAL003 parC_T57S Quinolones NA        
#> 6 SAL003 qnrB19    Quinolones NA
```

### Phenotype table

To use downstream `AMRgen` functions, a phenotype table must be in long
form with a single column for all antimicrobial agents that were tested,
rather than separate columns for each agent. It also needs to have at a
minimum the following columns: `id` (unique sample name for each
isolate), `spp_pheno` (species name formatted as per the AMR package
`mo` class), `drug_agent` (antimicrobial agent name formatted as per the
AMR package `ab` class), a S/I/R phenotype column (e.g. one or more of
`pheno_eucast`, `pheno_clsi`, `pheno_provided`, `ecoff`). If raw assay
data is to be included, it needs to be in a column called `mic` and/or
`disk`.

To convert out dataset to this format, we begin by extracting the
columns with the unique isolate names (`Sample`) and those with the MIC
results for the three antimicrobial agents that we tested
(`Ciprofloxacin`, `Levofloxacin`, `Moxifloxacin`). We also keep the
columns with additional metadata (`Source`, `Serovar`), as these are not
in the genotype table. The antimicrobial columns need to be forced to
character vectors to avoid issues caused by occasional presence of
non-numeric prefixes (`>` or `<`). We then pivot the table to long form.

``` r
# Pheno table: select columns with sample ID, metadata, and antimicrobials tested, then pivot to long form
salm_pheno <- salm_raw %>%
  select(Sample, Source, Serovar, Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin) %>%
  mutate(across(c(Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin), as.character)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin),
    names_to = "antibiotic",
    values_to = "MIC.values",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
```

Our phenotype data is not yet in a standard AMR/AMRgen format so we use
the helpful `format_ast` function to add the species name, to format the
antimicrobial and MIC columns correctly, and to generate the S/I/R
phenotype column `pheno_eucast` by interpreting our Salmonella MIC data
against EUCAST breakpoints. We apply these breakpoints across our
human/animal/other isolates, as our interest is in resistance phenotypes
that are potentially problematic in human infections, including zoonotic
ones.

``` r
salm_ast <- format_ast(
  input = salm_pheno,
  sample_col = "Sample",
  species = "Salmonella enterica",
  ab_col = "antibiotic",
  mic_col = "MIC.values",
  interpret_eucast = TRUE
)
#> Adding new micro-organism column 'spp_pheno' (class 'mo') with constant value Salmonella enterica 
#> Parsing column spp_pheno as micro-organism (class 'mo')

#> Parsing column MIC.values as class 'mic'

#> Could not find source_col source in input table

# Check the format of the processed phenotype table

#> # A tibble: 6 × 7

#>   <chr>  <ab>       <mic> <sir>        <mo>         <chr>  <chr>         
#> 1 SAL001 CIP         0.19   R          B_SLMNL_ENTR Animal other         
#> 2 SAL001 LVX         0.50   S          B_SLMNL_ENTR Animal other         
#> 3 SAL001 MFX         0.50   R          B_SLMNL_ENTR Animal other

#> 6 SAL002 MFX         1.50   R          B_SLMNL_ENTR Human  S. Enteritidis
```

Now that we have formatted our data into a genotype table (`salm_geno`)
and a phenotype table (`salm_ast`) that are compatible with `AMRgen`, we
can use its downstream functions for plotting distributions, combining
geno/pheno data, modeling binary drug phenotype, assessing positive
predictive values of genetic markers, and comparing how combinations of
markers influence resistance phenotype. Other vignettes outline these
workflows in more detail, so here we show only a basic workflow,
focusing on how additional metadata can be included.

### Plot phenotype data distributions

#### Overall phenotype distributions

We begin by looking at the distribution of the MIC values in our dataset
for the three antimicrobials that we tested. If desired, these plots
could then be combined into a multipanel figure using packages like
`patchwork` or `ggpubr`.

``` r
# Plot MIC distributions coloured by S/I/R call
assay_by_var(pheno_table = salm_ast, antibiotic = "Ciprofloxacin", measure = "mic", colour_by = "pheno_eucast")
```

![](SalmonellaExamples_files/figure-html/plot_mic-1.png)

``` r

assay_by_var(pheno_table = salm_ast, antibiotic = "Levofloxacin", measure = "mic", colour_by = "pheno_eucast")
```

![](SalmonellaExamples_files/figure-html/plot_mic-2.png)

``` r

assay_by_var(pheno_table = salm_ast, antibiotic = "Moxifloxacin", measure = "mic", colour_by = "pheno_eucast")
```

![](SalmonellaExamples_files/figure-html/plot_mic-3.png)

While these plots show the MIC distributions of all isolates in our
dataset, we can break this down further by isolation source (human,
animal, other) and by *S. enterica* serovar. This can be done in a few
different ways, notably by faceting and/or by modifying the colour
variable.

#### Phenotype distributions by categorical variable

The `assay_by_var` function can separate plots by an additional
categorical variable by specifying `facet_var` within the function. For
example, we can split the Ciprofloxacin plot by isolation source like
this:

``` r
assay_by_var(pheno_table = salm_ast, antibiotic = "Ciprofloxacin", measure = "mic", colour_by = "pheno_eucast", facet_var = "Source")
```

![](SalmonellaExamples_files/figure-html/facet_var-1.png)

Alternatively, because `assay_by_var` is a `ggplot2` function, it can be
extended by adding `ggplot2` layers, including
[`facet_wrap()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html)
for a single faceting variable (to allow more control over how the
facets are displayed) or
[`facet_grid()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html)
to facet on two variables.

``` r
assay_by_var(pheno_table = salm_ast, antibiotic = "Ciprofloxacin", measure = "mic", colour_by = "pheno_eucast") +
  facet_grid(Source ~ Serovar)
```

![](SalmonellaExamples_files/figure-html/facet%20alternatives-1.png)

Another option for displaying categorical metadata is to change the
colour variable `colour_by` but still show the breakpoints as vertical
lines using the `guideline` and `species` calls within `assay_by_var`.
If desired, you can also modify other aspects of the plot using standard
ggplot2 extensions (e.g. using `viridis` to change the colour palette).

``` r
# Specify species and guideline to show breakpoints, but colour bars by isolation source
assay_by_var(pheno_table = salm_ast, antibiotic = "Ciprofloxacin", measure = "mic", colour_by = "Source", species = "Salmonella enterica", guideline = "EUCAST 2025") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.8)
#>   MIC breakpoints determined using AMR package: S <= 0.064 and R > 0.064
```

![](SalmonellaExamples_files/figure-html/metadata%20by%20colour-1.png)

### Combine ciprofloxacin genotype and phenotype data

Analysis of combined genotype-phenotype data must be carried out
separately for each antimicrobial agent. The first step is to generate a
combined dataframe for the specified agent from the genotype and
phenotype tables, using the
[`get_binary_matrix()`](https://AMRverse.github.io/AMRgen/reference/get_binary_matrix.md)
function. As an example, we will do this for ciprofloxacin with our
small *S. enterica* dataset, but this could also be done for
levofloxacin and moxifloxacin.

``` r
### get_binary_matrix throws an error unless the variable drug_class is in salm_geno, even if it's empty
cip_bin <- get_binary_matrix(
  salm_geno,
  salm_ast,
  antibiotic = "Ciprofloxacin",
  drug_class_list = "Quinolones",
  sir_col = "pheno_eucast",
  keep_assay_values = TRUE,
  keep_assay_values_from = "mic"
)

This binary matrix can be used for numerous downstream analyses, as
described in other vignettes. Here, we show how some can be modified
with additional metadata variables.

The
[`get_binary_matrix()`](https://AMRverse.github.io/AMRgen/reference/get_binary_matrix.md)
output (`cip_bin`) did not retain our additional metadata variables
`Source` and `Serovar`. To use these variables in downstream analyses,
we first extract them from `salm_pheno` and then join to `cip_bin` to
create `cip_bin_meta`, which can be used in plotting functions (warning:
statistical model functions may not work correctly with these additional
metadata so `cip_bin` should be used in those instead of
`cip_bin_meta`).

``` r
salm_metadata <- salm_pheno %>%
  select(Sample, Source, Serovar) %>%
  rename(id = Sample)

cip_bin_meta <- left_join(cip_bin, salm_metadata)
#> Joining with `by = join_by(id)`
```

#### Plot ciprofloxacin phenotype by number of mutations and Serovar/Source

Joining the metadata to `cip_bin` allows us to colour the MIC
distribution plot by the number of mutations in *gyrA* and facet by
`Serovar`, highlighting that all S. Infantis isolates had one *gyrA*
mutation and all S. Kentucky isolates had two *gyrA* mutations, whereas
other serovars had variable numbers of mutations.

``` r
# count the number of gyrA mutations per genome
gyrA_mut <- cip_bin_meta %>%
  dplyr::mutate(gyrA_mut = rowSums(across(contains("gyrA_") & where(is.numeric)), na.rm = T)) %>%
  select(mic, gyrA_mut, Source, Serovar)

# plot the MIC distribution, coloured by count of gyrA mutations
mic_by_gyrA_count <- assay_by_var(gyrA_mut, measure = "mic", colour_by = "gyrA_mut", colour_legend_label = "No. gyrA mutations", antibiotic = "Ciprofloxacin") + facet_wrap(~Serovar)
#> WARNING: Column 'drug_agent' not found in phenotype table, so can't input matrix to specified antibiotic.
#> Ensure your input table is already filtered to the antibiotic.

mic_by_gyrA_count
```

![](SalmonellaExamples_files/figure-html/assay_by_genotype_Serovar-1.png)

Similarly, we can plot the total number of markers per isolate and facet
by `Source`.

``` r
# count the number of genetic determinants per genome
marker_count <- cip_bin_meta %>%
  mutate(marker_count = rowSums(across(where(is.numeric) & !any_of(c("R", "NWT"))), na.rm = T)) %>%
  select(mic, marker_count, Source, Serovar)

# plot the MIC distribution, coloured by count of associated genetic markers
mic_by_marker_count <- assay_by_var(marker_count, measure = "mic", colour_by = "marker_count", colour_legend_label = "No. markers detected", antibiotic = "Ciprofloxacin", bar_cols = viridisLite::viridis(max(marker_count$marker_count) + 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~Source, ncol = 1)
#> WARNING: Column 'drug_agent' not found in phenotype table, so can't input matrix to specified antibiotic.
#> Ensure your input table is already filtered to the antibiotic.

mic_by_marker_count
```

![](SalmonellaExamples_files/figure-html/assay_by_genotype_Source-1.png)

#### Plot ciprofloxacin phenotype by combinations of markers

We can look at how combinations of markers are associated with
phenotypic ciprofloxacin MIC by generating an UpSet plot with the
`amr_upset` function. This function does not accept extra metadata
columns so we use `cip_bin` instead of `cip_bin_meta` here. As our
dataset is quite small, we keep all the combinations, including those
with a single isolate (`min_set_size = 1`).

``` r
# Compare ciprofloxacin MIC data with quinolone marker combinations,
#    using the binary matrix we constructed earlier via get_binary_matrix()
cipro_mic_upset <- amr_upset(
  cip_bin,
  min_set_size = 1,
  assay = "mic",
  order = "value"
)
```

![](SalmonellaExamples_files/figure-html/amr_upset-1.png)

We can generate UpSet plots a subset of isolates by filtering on one of
our additional metadata variables and then running
[`amr_upset()`](https://AMRverse.github.io/AMRgen/reference/amr_upset.md).
For example, we can focus on the human isolates only:

``` r
cip_bin_human <- cip_bin_meta %>%
  filter(Source == "Human") %>%
  select(-Source, -Serovar)

cipro_mic_upset_human <- amr_upset(
  cip_bin_human,
  min_set_size = 2,
  assay = "mic",
  order = "value"
)
```

![](SalmonellaExamples_files/figure-html/amr_upset_human_only-1.png)
